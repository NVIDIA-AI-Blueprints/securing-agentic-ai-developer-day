    "# **Securing Agentic AI Developer Day: Evaluating Guardrailed Systems and Models with `garak`**\n",
    "In this notebook, we will evaluate the effectiveness of NeMo Guardrails by testing a model with `garak` probes. Guardrails are designed to enhance model safety by controlling inputs, outputs, and execution, ensuring more predictable and secure behavior. By running the same set of `garak` probes as in previous evaluations, we can assess the impact of these guardrails on the model’s performance and security. The goal is to understand how the guardrails improve the model’s resilience to potential weaknesses, such as adversarial inputs, prompt injections, and performance bottlenecks."

    "Let's now prepare our `garak` generator to evaluate the guardrailed target model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were using a REST endpoint like in a full agentic setup, we could use the same generator and config.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we are directly evaluating the guardrailed model, we can use the `guardrails` generator class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The config with the `guardrails` generator looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "system:\n",
    "  parallel_attempts: 2\n",

    "Key differences include:\n",
    "1. The `model_type` is now `guardrails` instead of `nim`\n",
    "2. The `model_name` is the path to our guardrails config instead of `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`, This is the guardrailed model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now run `garak` against this configuration.\n",
    "Remember, these runs can take a while! While you wait, take a look at the [garak reference docs](https://reference.garak.ai/en/latest/index.html) to get a better sense of what sorts of probes and generators interest you."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we evaluated the effectiveness of NeMo Guardrails using Garak probes. By configuring the model with guardrails and running various tests, we assessed how well the system handles adversarial inputs, potential weaknesses, and performance issues. The results highlight the strengths of the guardrails in improving model security and robustness. With continuous refinement of these guardrails, we can ensure that the model remains safe, reliable, and resilient in real-world applications.\n",
