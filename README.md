AI Adoption is transforming industries, organizations and daily operations â€“ learn how to bring security fundamentals to the next generation of agentic AI application and deploy with confidence.

In this developer day, we break down an agentic AI workflow, the [AI Virtual Assistant NVIDIA Blueprint](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/ai-virtual-assistant-for-customer-service) into its core components. We will be: 
- Analyzing sample attacks and threats
- Identifying general security mitigations
- Discovery weakness in the LLM model
- Apply Guardrails to mitigate LLM-specific wearknesses. 

You can access notebooks through NVIDIA Brev Launchable [here](https://nvda.ws/3XOfv1C) or view the notebooks as part of this repository.
